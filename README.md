Dear Mama, Happy birthday! It's been nearly two years since we were all together as a family. Some people say smell is the most powerful way of triggering memories but for our family, maybe sounds are more effective?

## Chopin Nocturne Op.9, No. 2 in E flat

{% include youtubePlayer.html id="Nu48Z45ibxQ" %}

One of our earliest musical memories is you playing CDs for us when we were going to sleep.

## King of Glory, King of Peace

{% include youtubePlayer.html id="ikj7CiC7v0U" %}

We wanted to find some hymns with nice tunes, which reminded Dajie of all your thoughts on hymn tunes when we were wedding planning.

## Rock of Ages, Cleft for Me

{% include youtubePlayer.html id="zPFhwh6uGVw" %}

Some of the hymns you taught us when we were little don't seem to be that common in modern churches, but we still remember and love them.

## Ein Männlein steht im Walde

{% include youtubePlayer.html id="s5bVQcpSrUE" %}

We used to listen to German cassettes in the car even though we didn’t understand anything they were saying. Now sometimes when Dajie goes to pick Kaikai up she's listening to German news and he has no idea what they're saying!

## Danket, danket dem Herrn

{% include youtubePlayer.html id="VBpa0Iq622E" %}

Papa remembers this as one of the very earliest songs that you sang to Dajie and Erjie when they were little.

## 康定情歌

{% include youtubePlayer.html id="O4apnJ-VQaE" %}

This video combines two things that remind us of you a lot - TV talent shows, and traditional folk singing. You taught us songs like 讀書郎 but you never remembered more than a couple of phrases of this one, but it still stuck in our heads.

## 得民心者得天下

{% include youtubePlayer.html id="aaFe-YToVeM" %}

Remember the days of 一家老小追劇集... and 追 intense political historical drama, no less!

## 倩女幽魂

{% include youtubePlayer.html id="mksWjZmtooQ" %}

Whenever someone died, you'd make sure to catch all the tribute shows on TV, and show us how great an artist they were, even though you never told us about them when they were alive. This is how we were introduced to 黃霑, 張國榮, and even...

## Michael Jackson

{% include youtubePlayer.html id="N9U9A4_cgyI" %}

Yes, even Michael Jackson!

## 一生何求

{% include youtubePlayer.html id="WquCJA9iYJM" %}

After Zixin learned this song from you, it became one of the only songs he could sing at karaoke. His friends love it.

## Selkirk Grace

{% include youtubePlayer.html id="2BHX8Qj-DQs" %}

This reminds Papa of your time in Aberdeen.

## Christmas

{% include youtubePlayer.html id="QzI3MVMob28" %}

Christmas was always full of music, from the Messiah to Carols from Kings. Even if we weren't at home for Christmas, listening to and singing the same music would help us feel closer to the family.

## 真的愛你

Thank you for all the wonderful memories, and for the love of music, tradition, language and so much more that you gave us. Can't wait to be able to travel again and make more memories together! Happy birthday Mama!

P.S. [here's a youtube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLcBISwwIyfMdTV4tOE8ijwGL26LS8pHQc) of these songs plus a few others!
